This program is used to call Bingo numbers. <br>
I used my children's voices to create the audio files. <br>
You can play with your choice of cards. We use cards purchased from Amazon to play the game. <br>

<h3> Features </h3>
Written in C# using WinForms. <br>
Uses multithreading to keep the UI active while numbers are called. <br>

<h3> How to play </h3>

The user interface consists of a Bingo board. <br>
Right click on the board to select the speed the numbers will be called.<br>
Right click and select start game.<br>
After each number is called, the number is highlighted on the board. <br>
When a person has a bingo and calls "BINGO" , right click the bingo board to stop the game. <br>
The last number called will be shown. <br>
You will be asked if the Bingo is valid or not. <br>
If valid, the game ends and a new game can begin.<br>
If not valid, click "no" and the game continues.<br>
